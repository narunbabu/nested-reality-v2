[06/01, 6:03 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: that we are on the same page, here is my idea of time and space. We need to be on same page for further discussion. Let’s park the discussion of what’s “the thing” for later. 

So here is how I define space: Where something exists. 
Where there is no matter/energy, there is no space. How far two objects are in space is a function of how entangled they are. So space is a property of “the thing” (call it mass, energy, purusha or what ever) and not fundamental. So “the thing” is not in space but space is a function of that thing.
Let’s consider the Big Bang universe to be true for a moment to explain what mean. 
So the statement what’s beyond universe or what this the Big Bang happened in, is meaningless. Big Bang did not happen into something as it is the process that created space. We cannot intuitively imaging no space. So any continuous thing can be also said to be separated by infinite ‘no space’ for all it matters. For distance and thus density are relative to the illusion (Maya) of space.

How do I define time: it is simply change. Imaging nothing is changing, not even the location of electrons. That’s like frozen in time. That’s “no time”. Of something changes, there is time and even the parts that are not changing are experiencing time relative to what’s changing. Time is a property of “the change” in the thing, and not fundamental.
Let’s consider the Big Bang universe to be true for a moment to explain what mean. 
So the statement what’s before universe or when the Big Bang happened, is meaningless. Big Bang did not happen at all particular time as it is the process that created time. We cannot intuitively imaging no time. So any continuous event can also said to be separated by infinite ‘no time’ for all it matters. For time and thus change/adjustment are relative to the illusion (Maya) of time.
[06/01, 6:36 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Other question:
RGC is resistance to gradient change or radial gradient consistency?

[06/01, 8:02 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Questions till chapter 8:
Sub 
By my definition space is the structure, and inseparable. What do you mean by pre-spatial structural notion?
By my definition Reconfiguration is time, and inseparable. Nature’s aversion to abruptness a factor in time that is Maya and relative. That to you appear as not abrupt can be abrupt in another perspective. That statement is not a property of nature but human perspective of nature through lens of maya. 

Can you write about pre‑spatial “regions” and “reconfiguration” in a way that does not covertly assume space and time?



“If something exists at all, there must be differences” - Why should there be difference? 

Difference assumes relativity. Then the question is relative to what? You can go ahead and say relative to itself. That also assumes the parts are moving differently relative to each other and “the thing” is not uniform. When you same non-uniform, that becomes the basis of differentiation and classification. The Swabhaba changes from place to place. From unstable to stable. And if there are stable configurations, why was there instability in the first place? What makes some density configurations more likely than other?

If environment was uniform nothing would move. Why is there imbalance. 

Why does different things of similar density have different properties?

If you reify density/imbalance as the final, real primitive, you risk building a new quasi‑svabhāva.

If movement requires difference, then you already assume more than one thing. One that moves, and the thing relative to which it is moving or changing.

“Changes in motion reflect changes in environment “ means environment is another svabhava that influence the density 

This takes us to the heart of Upanishad-Mahayana debate. If there is only one fundamental entity there is only uniformity. If there is change then there is differentiation, and thus duality.

According to Nagarjuna: If Brahman (or the thing)  is the unaffected substrate, how does Maya (say change or imbalance or movement) arise without duality (needing an “other” to veil)? If non-dual, Maya cannot superimpose without altering Brahman, contradicting its changelessness.
Emptiness applies universally—even to Brahman or consciousness as “ultimate reality”—revealing no independent essence anywhere, unlike Advaita’s affirmation of Brahman as positive ground.
Restating the question, if density fields is all there is, how does hierarchy arise, how does internal and external rearrangement arise without duality? Motion cannot emerge by itself because there needs to be a property that’s causes it to change to a more stable configuration. So far the terms like force are used to talk about that property. Force is not an external cause, but internal since everything is part of a closed system we call universe.

[07/01, 12:04 am] Arun: Subhrashis, thank you for this level of engagement. You are not pressing on surface claims but on the ontological closure of the framework itself. That pressure is both legitimate and necessary, and it has helped me state the book’s core axiom more cleanly.

I’ll respond concisely but structurally.

1. Clarifying RGC (Housekeeping)

You’re right to flag the ambiguity.

RGC formally means Radial Gradient Consistency.
“Resistance to gradient change” is not the axiom; it is the phenomenological consequence.

RGC is not a force, tendency, or preference.
It is an admissibility constraint: configurations that violate smooth gradient continuity cannot persist. What appears as resistance is simply the impossibility of certain paths.

2. Space and Time — Logical Priority, Not Temporal Priority

Your definitions of space and time are aligned with the book.

Space is not a container but a relational property of existence.

Time is not a background flow but ordered change.

When the book uses pre-spatial or pre-temporal, it does not mean “before” in a chronological sense. It means logically prior.

Space and time are not assumed in order to define density;
density is what makes space and time describable at all.

A “region” in the book is not a geometric location.
It is a degree of persistence within continuity.
No coordinates are presupposed.

“Reconfiguration” does not assume time.
It names non-identity of structure, from which time later emerges once endurance and comparability exist.

So yes — Big Bang did not happen in space or at a time. It is part of the process by which space-time becomes meaningful.

3. The Core Question: “Why Difference at All?”

This is the real hinge, and your critique is correct:
if I simply declare “imbalance” primitive, I would be re-introducing svabhāva by another name.

The book’s position is stronger:

Absolute uniformity is indistinguishable from non-existence.

A perfectly uniform reality would have:

no distinction → no space

no reconfiguration → no time

no persistence → no identity

no relations → nothing speakable

Two perfectly identical “points” are not two. They collapse into one description — and that description collapses into nothing expressible.

So the question “Why is there difference?” is equivalent to
“Why is there existence at all?”

Difference is not added to being.
Difference is what existence means.

This is why the framework does not say:

uniformity existed and then broke

something came from nothing

Both are meaningless.

Uniformity is not a hidden starting state; it is an uninstantiable limit — like absolute zero or infinite rigidity.

4. Density Without Reification (Svabhāva Guardrail)

Density in LDS–NDD is not a substance, field, or positive ground.

It names:

degrees of resistance to reconfiguration within continuity

Density has:

no fixed value

no independent essence

no existence apart from relations

It is always relative, scale-dependent, and context-bound.

This is why the book insists:

density is descriptive, not constitutive

gradients exist, but only relationally

nothing “possesses” density as a property

So density does not replace force as a hidden cause.
It replaces force as an explanatory metaphor.

5. Motion Without Duality

You correctly note that motion seems to require at least two relata.

The framework avoids this by rejecting motion as an action.

Motion is not something done by one thing to another.
It is the cheapest resolution of inadmissible configuration within a single continuous structure.

There is no mover and moved.
There is only:

persistence that survives

configurations that do not

RGC does not cause motion.
It excludes paths that would require abrupt, destructive restructuring.

What remains is what we observe as motion.

6. Hierarchy, Nesting, and the Maya Concern

Nesting in the book is not ontological layering.

It is scale-dependent stabilization:

child bodies are local intensifications of parent continuity

internal/external are perspectival, not absolute

environment/system distinctions emerge only after persistence exists

This avoids both extremes:

Advaita-style eternal substrate, and

Madhyamaka inert emptiness

Which brings us to the final point.

7. Shunya vs “Active Continuity”

I agree with your intuition that pure inert nothingness cannot account for a universe full of persistence, adaptation, and self-reference.

But the book is careful here.

It does not introduce a second principle called “activity”.

Rather, it states:

Existence cannot be absolutely still.

Not as intention, force, or will — but as non-absolute stillness.

If even that were absent, there would be nothing to speak, know, or evolve — not even emptiness-with-structure, but sheer nothing.

Life then is not an anomaly.
It is a configuration where continuity becomes sensitive to itself — where persistence turns reflexive.

No added duality.
No positive essence.
No final ground.

8. Where This Leaves the Framework

LDS–NDD begins where explanation cannot be reduced further:

not with objects

not with forces

not with space or time

not with emptiness as a thing

But with this minimal axiom:

Existence is non-uniform continuity.
Absolute uniformity is indistinguishable from non-existence.

Everything else — space, time, motion, hierarchy, life — follows as consequence, not assumption.

Your critique sharpened this articulation. It did not weaken it.

And yes — this is exactly the Upanishad–Madhyamaka fault line.
The framework tries to walk that narrow ridge without falling into either reification or nihilism.

That dialogue is not closed — but it is now honestly framed.
