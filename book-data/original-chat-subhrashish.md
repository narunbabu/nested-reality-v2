These are the chats
[03/01, 2:26 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: The ground beneath you had a shape that could not support stillness. [03/01, 2:26 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: What do you mean by this? [03/01, 2:27 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: There is no slope without gravity [03/01, 6:18 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: What does this mean: At human scales we accept imbalance as sufficient explanation; only at larger scales do we insist on invisible forces. [03/01, 6:19 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Photon dependent visibility is not criterion of existence, and even in small human scale we talk of forces [03/01, 6:21 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: “Space is black. Matter is bright. Everything else is void.” This is not true. [03/01, 6:22 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Black and dark are only photon dependent. Matter can be dark. And this no true vacuum … space between “matter” is not void according to physics [03/01, 6:30 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Why is 'space' the lowest-density limit of material continuity? Material and high density is also space? [03/01, 6:56 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: “particles may be structures of something continuous rather than isolated objects.” I think this is what modern physics says too. Everything that we perceive is “made”something fundamental that we did not evolve to perceive. There is gradient within that allows things to move and forces to exist. Space, time, objects, particles emerge from it. That creates structures that we perceive as different objects in our mental model (which is also a controlled hallucination created by evolution). The universe moves from gradient to no gradient (3rd law of thermodynamics). At complete equilibrium gradient will be lost, all structures will be lost, so will everything we perceive as Space, time, objects, particles … [03/01, 6:56 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Read the first 3 chapters. That my thoughts from that. Will check the rest later and get back with my comments for discussions [03/01, 11:36 pm] Arun: Thanks Subhrashish. These are thoughtful questions — thank you for reading so attentively. I will answer them shortly. [03/01, 11:51 pm] Arun: This is tricky area im dealing with. I meant to say that the geometry of the ground made stillness unstable. It includes change/motion inseparable from shape (layered structure) [04/01, 12:11 am] Arun: I was using geometry/instability, the way motion was intuitively understood even before gravity was formalized. [04/01, 12:15 am] Arun: And in everyday language of uneducated (gravity) [04/01, 12:16 am] Arun: What I mean is this: at everyday scales, we’re comfortable explaining motion by saying a position is unstable or imbalanced (like slipping on a slope) without imagining an invisible pull acting step-by-step. When we go to planetary or cosmic scales, we tend to switch language and explain the same kind of adjustment using invisible forces. I’m pointing to that shift in explanatory habit, not denying the physics. [04/01, 12:16 am] Arun: Though by physicists [04/01, 10:36 am] Subhrashis Adhikari: My concern with that statement is this: 1. Shape has nothing to do with movement. 2. Gradient has nothing to do with movement 1. There is no slope or slipping on a slope because of shape. To slip on a slope one need a up/down direction, which comes only because of mass/gravity. Down is the direction of gravity. Imagine a slide in zero gravity. You will not slip along the slide just because of its shape. 2. Imagine coarsening or fining upward sequences. They have gradient, but there is no movement or apparent force created out of it. Diffusion across gradient (apart from non-brownian diffusion) happens due to Brownian motion. So….To explain gradient and structure and motion you need to define Brownian motion and mass. [04/01, 4:43 pm] Arun: This is really helpful — you’re pressing exactly on the distinction I’m trying to make. You’re right at the level of mechanism: if we start with mass, forces, brownian motion, etc., then shape by itself doesn’t cause motion. A slide in zero-G does nothing, and diffusion needs Brownian motion. I completely agree with that. The book is deliberately operating one layer deeper, at the level of ontology rather than mechanism. When I say shape or gradient, I’m not talking about a plastic slide; I’m talking about the shape of the density field itself. In that sense, what we call gravity is a density gradient, and what we call zero-G is a region of uniform density. – If density is uniform, there’s no imbalance, so nothing moves. – If there’s a gradient, motion appears as the cheapest way to resolve that imbalance. So we actually agree on the outcome (when things move and when they don’t). The difference is only in what we take as primitive: – you start from force + mass, – I start from imbalance + density. I’m not trying to replace the mathematics of gravity or Brownian motion. I’m asking a prior question: why does nature prefer equilibration at all? The book’s experiment is to treat motion not as a push, but as a selection of the most stable configuration available. I know this feels backwards from a physics-first perspective — that reversal is intentional, and it’s really the core nature of the book. [04/01, 4:52 pm] Arun: I agree with most of this. Physics already treats particles and forces as emergent. My only real additions are (1) treating space and matter as density regimes of one continuity, and (2) rejecting a final no-gradient equilibrium in favor of nested, constrained redistribution. [04/01, 4:54 pm] Arun: Im traveling. Let me reply later the light part. Im very thankful for this discussion. Please keep throwing these questions [04/01, 8:49 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: What do you mean by density? Density of what? [04/01, 10:47 pm] Arun: This actually starts getting covered from Chapter 5 onward, but since you’ve asked now, there’s no harm in clarifying it briefly. Initially, I did think of density in the usual sense — the number of particles or atoms per unit volume. That’s where the intuition began. As I tried to carry this idea across different domains, however, it became clear that “counting particles” already assumes particles are fundamental. What was interesting is that the explanatory role of density survived even when particle language broke down — in space, fields, motion, stability, and even biological organization. So the concept had to generalize. Density stopped meaning simply “how many things are there” and instead became “how resistant a region is to reconfiguration.” In this view, particles appear as stabilized outcomes of that resistance, not the starting point. In a universe like ours, where resistance is carried by stable, localized structures, this generalized notion naturally reduces operationally to particle or mass density. But that reduction is contingent, not fundamental. In other words, particle density was the entry point, not the destination — and the book makes this transition explicit from Chapter 5 onward.

[05/01, 1:40 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: When you say resistance, region, and change/reconfiguration you are assuming that there is space, time and something that is resistant as fundamental. I am not convinced that space time is fundamental. I have the same opinion about you on mathematics. I don’t think mathematics represents reality, but it is how our brain simplifies the brain model to represent reality by allowing us to patter recognise, group and classify things without which you don’t have the fundamental units for maths to exist. I also agree that forces and particles are not fundamental. Physics says the same thing. In standard dynamics, forces, potentials, and stability are just different, intertranslatable representations of the same underlying structure. But remember imbalance and density needs space and some entity , and any change or resistance to change required time. None of which is fundamental. Space can well be a measure of how entangled two particles are.

[05/01, 2:24 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Modern physics does not claim to have observed absolute emptiness; instead, it operationally defines vacuum as a limiting state (e.g., lowest achievable pressure, ground state of a field), so the your argument that “empty space has never been observed” is accurate but is already acknowledged in practice. [05/01, 2:25 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: In quantum field theory, the vacuum is defined as the ground state of one or more quantum fields, generally possessing zero-point fluctuations and an associated energy density, not as the absence of all properties. [05/01, 2:31 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: “reality is fundamentally composed of discrete, independent particles.” That could be the view of layman, not scientists. Even in standard model it is elementary particles and force carriers and not fundamental particles [05/01, 2:47 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: I agree with the following, and I think that the general scientific concensus. Force is not fundamental. Vacuum is not empty. Particles are not fundamental. Mathematics is not reality. [05/01, 2:48 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: One need to also think of epistemology and not just ontology. We base our theories on our observed reality. But that is just a proxy predictive model, not reality [05/01, 2:52 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Let me add to this two truths of Mahayana Buddhism: The conventional truth (saṁvṛti satya) is the fact that, provisionally speaking, phenomena have a nature or existence (bhāva). For example, a property of fire is heat and so on. This is the truth of the everyday world (lokasaṁvṛtisatya) and the truth of conventional transaction (vyavahārasatya). However, these conventional properties are not intrinsic natures or svabhāvas (even conventionally speaking), since for Chandra, even conventional truth is empty of intrinsic natures. This view differentiates Chandrakirti from other madhyamikas like Bhāviveka which affirm the conventional existence of intrinsic natures. Regarding the ultimate truth (paramārtha satya), when fire is analyzed to find its ultimate nature, no independent essence is found that makes fire hot, and thus fire (and all things, including the most basic concepts like time and causality) have no ultimate essence or nature. This is the ultimate truth i.e. emptiness (śūnyatā) or the lack of self-existence (niḥsvabhāva). It is this very lack of inherent nature in conventional truth that allows it to change and have causal efficacy (arthakriya) and thus, to be a dependent arising (pratītyasamutpāda). [05/01, 2:54 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Sunyata as ultimate reality and all we observe emerge from dependent origination [05/01, 2:56 pm] Subhrashis Adhikari: Will start with chapter 5 next

[05/01, 3:41 pm] Arun: I think you’re pressing on exactly the right fault line, and I agree with more of what you’re saying than my earlier wording probably conveyed. You’re right that if I casually use words like “region,” “resistance,” or “change,” it can sound as if I’m quietly assuming space, time, and some resisting entity as primitives. That would indeed collapse the framework — and that’s not what I’m trying to do. In LDS–NDD, density is not defined inside space, and change is not defined inside time. Those come later. Density is introduced as a pre-spatial structural notion — essentially persistence versus reconfiguration. By “region,” I don’t mean a geometric container; I mean differentiation. If something exists at all, there must be differences — some parts persist, some rearrange, some resist more than others. That minimal differentiation is what the word “region” is pointing to, not coordinate space. Likewise, when I talk about change, I’m not assuming a fundamental temporal flow. I’m pointing to reconfiguration. Time, in this view, emerges later as a way of ordering admissible sequences of reconfiguration once constraints are in place. This is also where the Plenum assumption in the book matters. I’m not ignoring space or treating it as an abstract stage. The proposal is that what we call “space” — including vacuum — is itself a physical, continuous limit of the same material structure, just at extremely low density. So extension isn’t something density sits in; extension is something density gradients give rise to. Where I differ slightly from your framing is methodological. Physics often uses mathematically equivalent descriptions — forces, potentials, stability — but still tends to treat space–time or Hilbert space as a given backdrop. What I’m experimenting with is whether we can remove the backdrop entirely and let space, time, particles, and forces appear as constrained manifestations of density evolution. Your entanglement remark fits naturally here. Distance as a measure of relational coupling rather than separation feels compatible with this approach, not opposed to it — possibly a formal lens through which parts of it could later be expressed. At this stage, I’m treating all of this as a working explanatory tool, not a closed metaphysics. The test I care about first is whether a single primitive can carry us coherently from physics to chemistry to life without switching explanatory language or invoking special exceptions. I genuinely value this pushback. Do you feel this is a reasonable way to proceed — testing whether the tool earns its keep — or do you think it still assumes too much too early and needs a different starting point? [06/01, 4:34 am] Arun: These are brilliant connections. I think we’re very much aligned, and your distinction between what modern physics does mathematically and the intuition we use to explain it is exactly where this book is trying to sit. On the vacuum point, you’re absolutely right — QFT has long abandoned the idea of absolute emptiness and defines vacuum as a limiting ground state with fluctuations and energy density. Professional physics knows the box isn’t empty. My concern in the book is that our ontological story hasn’t quite caught up with that mathematics. Even when the equations describe a plenum, we still tend to speak and think in terms of discrete objects moving through a void. LDS–NDD is an attempt to offer a physical picture that matches what QFT already encodes mathematically: a continuous field in which “things” appear as localized intensifications or structures, not independent substances. Your reference to dependent origination is very much on point, and I’m glad you brought it up. The resonance with pratītyasamutpāda is intentional, even if approached from a different direction. At the level of conventional truth, we experience apparently independent entities — planets, atoms, bodies. But at the structural level used in LDS–NDD, there are no independent objects in themselves. What we call an object exists only as a continuous modification of a larger parent structure. Identity is not intrinsic; it’s relational and conditional. In that sense, I see this framework as an attempt to translate śūnyatā — the absence of inherent essence — into a structural language (density and nesting) that can also account for why conventional stability persists long enough to be meaningful and causal. I’m glad you’re moving on to Chapter 5. That’s where “density” shifts from a mostly critical role into a constructive explanatory tool. I’m genuinely curious how it lands for you there. [06/01, 4:42 am] Arun: Thanks for sharing those early thoughts — they make a lot of sense in hindsight. The first three chapters were intentionally ground-clearing, so ideas like visibility, vacuum, particles, and gradients were still being discussed inside familiar language. Chapter 5 is where the shift becomes explicit: density is no longer treated as something in space, but as a structural primitive from which space, objects, and stability are derived. That’s also where “space as the lowest-density limit of continuity” is meant to be read — not as a metaphor about darkness or emptiness, but as a consequence of the plenum assumption. At this point, I’m less interested in defending the early framing and more curious whether the density-first move in Chapter 5 resolves some of those initial tensions, or creates new ones. I’d really value your take on it from here
