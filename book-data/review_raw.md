Nested Reality and Related Theories
Arun Babu Nalamara’s Nested Reality (2023) is a self-published proposal reframing physics in terms of density across hierarchical layers. In his own words (via social media) “matter, gravity, and even life emerge from how density balances itself across nested structures.” Though the full text isn’t publicly available, we interpret Nested Reality as a concept positing that fundamental phenomena arise from patterns of density in nested levels of reality. Below we survey other theories that similarly envision layered or multi-level reality, grouping them by theme (simulation, multiverse/cosmology, consciousness, information) and noting key proponents. For each, we briefly describe the idea and how it aligns or contrasts with the Nested Reality notion of layered structure.
Simulation Theories
Key idea: The universe is an artificial simulation or nested simulations. The classic Simulation Hypothesis (Nick Bostrom, 2003) argues that a future civilization might run many realistic universe simulations, making it likely we ourselves are in one
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. In this view reality has layers (base reality and simulated reality) akin to “nested” worlds. Variants include the “Matrix” scenario or the philosophical “brain-in-a-vat” thought experiment.
Nick Bostrom (2003): Proposed the simulation argument (a trilemma): if advanced civilizations can create many conscious simulations, we are probably inside one
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
.
Nested Simulations: Some thinkers ask if simulations could be recursive (simulators within simulators). One view holds an infinite regress is impossible without a first (base) reality
philosophy.stackexchange.com
. Another view allows infinite nesting in principle
philosophy.stackexchange.com
, though practical constraints (energy, time) likely prevent it.
Comparison: Like Nested Reality, simulation theories posit multiple reality layers. However, simulation layers are digital and artificial, whereas Nalamara’s layers seem physical (density-based). Simulation theory often treats consciousness as computable; Nalamara’s focus is on physical emergence from density. Table: Simulation-Related Hypotheses

Nested Simulations	(Philosophical)	The idea of simulators “all the way down” – worlds simulated within worlds. Some argue an ultimate base reality is needed (no infinite regress)
philosophy.stackexchange.com
.
Brain-in-a-Vat / Matrix	(Plato, Descartes, modern popularizers)	Early forms of simulated reality: our experiences are generated by an external source (e.g. an evil demon, VR).
Multiverse and Cosmology Theories
Key idea: There are many (often infinite) universes or “realms” beyond our own. Max Tegmark’s Multiverse classifies four levels: from distant regions of our own space (Level I) to universes with different laws (Level II), to quantum many-worlds (Level III), to all mathematical structures (Level IV)
en.wikipedia.org
. Brian Greene outlines nine multiverse types (e.g. quilted, inflationary, brane-world, cyclic, quantum/MWI, holographic, simulated, ultimate)
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Notable examples:
Inflationary Multiverse (Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, 1980s+): Eternal cosmic inflation spawns bubble universes with possibly different constants.
Brane World (Higher-D) (Lisa Randall, colleagues): Our 3D universe is a “brane” in higher-dimensional space; other branes parallel us
en.wikipedia.org
. Collisions of branes could create big-bang events.
Many-Worlds Interpretation (Hugh Everett, 1957): Every quantum event branches a new universe (effectively an uncountable multiverse). Greene calls this the “quantum multiverse”
en.wikipedia.org
.
Cosmic Natural Selection (Lee Smolin, 1992): Each black hole births a new “baby” universe, whose constants may vary. Universes “evolve” to maximize black-hole production
en.wikipedia.org
.
Comparison: Multiverse ideas and Nested Reality both posit layers or copies of reality. However, typical multiverses are often parallel or consequence-of-physics (inflation, quantum) rather than hierarchical by design. Nalamara’s model seems to suggest interlinked layers of density within one cosmos, whereas multiverse models usually posit many distinct cosmoses. That said, Smolin’s “nested universe” idea (our universe arising from a black hole in a parent universe
physicsforums.com
en.wikipedia.org
) is closely analogous to a universe within a universe, echoing the “nested” theme. Table: Multiverse/Cosmology Hypotheses
Theory / Hypothesis	Key Proponent(s)	Key Idea
Level I–IV Multiverse	Max Tegmark (2003, 2014)	Four “levels” of multiverse: from far-away regions of space (Level I) to all math structures (Level IV)

Brane Multiverse	Lisa Randall, et al.	Our universe is one 3D “brane” in higher dimensions; other branes are parallel universes

Inflationary Multiverse	Alan Guth, Andrei Linde	Eternal inflation creates “bubble” universes with varying properties.
Many-Worlds (Quantum)	Hugh Everett (1957)	Each quantum outcome splits off a new universe (a level of Tegmark’s Level III)

Modal Realism	David Lewis (1986)	(Philosophical) All logically possible worlds exist as concretely as ours.
Hierarchical Consciousness Theories
Key idea: Conscious experience arises from nested or layered cognitive processes. Modern neuroscience explores how “multiple streams” of information might integrate into a unified mind. For example, the Nested Observer Windows (NOW) model (Riddle & Schooler, 2024) likens the brain to a hierarchy of nested “observer windows”. Lower-level windows process details, with a top-level “window” integrating them into a unitary consciousness
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In this model, our singular experience sits at the apex of a nested mosaic of subprocesses.
NOW Model (Nested Observer Windows): Proposes that at each spatial-temporal scale the brain forms “observer windows” of synchronized activity, and these are nested like mosaic tiles. A top-level window produces unified awareness, while many lower windows carry out parallel processing
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Global Workspace Theory (Bernard Baars, 1988): Suggests all information competes in a single “workspace” for conscious access. (By contrast, NOW explicitly posits multiple coexisting streams beneath the surface.)
Integrated Information Theory (Giulio Tononi): Consciousness corresponds to irreducible integrated information (Φ). While not explicitly hierarchical, IIT also treats reality (experience) as arising from a complex structure of information integration.
Comparison: These “nested mind” ideas echo the multilayer motif of Nested Reality, but in the domain of psyche rather than external world. Nalamara’s theory is ontological (how matter behaves); consciousness theories are phenomenological (how mind arises). Still, both suggest a hierarchical structure underlies apparent unity. Nested Reality’s layers of density might loosely parallel layers of cognitive processing. Table: Nested Consciousness Models
Theory / Hypothesis	Key Proponent(s)	Key Idea
Nested Observer Windows (NOW)	Justin Riddle & Jonathan Schooler (2024)	The mind is a hierarchy of nested “observer windows” (mosaic tiles); unitary consciousness is at the top while many sub-windows process in parallel
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Global Workspace Theory	Bernard Baars (1988+)	A single global “workspace” broadcasts information across the brain, yielding unified awareness (less emphasis on nested substreams).
Integrated Information Theory	Giulio Tononi (2004+)	Consciousness equals integrated information (Φ) generated by the brain’s network; not explicitly layered, but treats reality as informational structure.
Hierarchical Predictive Coding	Karl Friston (2010s)	The brain predicts sensory input via a hierarchy of layers; perception emerges from top-down/bottom-up loops. (Nested loops of inference.)
Digital & Informational Ontologies
Key idea: Reality itself is fundamentally information or computation. In Digital Physics, the universe is treated as a gigantic computer or cellular automaton. Konrad Zuse (1969) first suggested the universe is computed (German Rechnender Raum); Edward Fredkin coined “digital physics” (1978)
en.wikipedia.org
. Jürgen Schmidhuber and others have formalized “All computable universes” ideas. John Wheeler’s famous aphorism “it from bit” (1989) encapsulates this: every physical “it” (particle, field) arises from binary answers to yes-no questions.
Digital Physics (Zuse, Fredkin, Wolfram, Schmidhuber): Universe = information. There exists (in principle) a program or automaton that evolves all physics
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Space, time and particles are emergent from discrete bits.
It from Bit (John Wheeler): Physical reality emerges from binary information. (Wheeler’s participatory universe suggests observation/measurement is fundamental.)
Simulation Hypothesis overlap: If the cosmos is a computation, one could view it as a self-simulation. This blurs lines between informational ontology and simulation theory.
Comparison: Digital physics shares with Nested Reality the idea that our familiar continuum may be emergent. Instead of “density” balancing, it posits bit-level computation. Nalamara’s density fields might conceivably be coded information, but his focus seems classical (mass, gravity) rather than quantum/computational. Still, both perspectives see underlying structures (bits or densities) giving rise to observed phenomena. Table: Digital/Informational Theories
Theory / Hypothesis	Key Proponent(s)	Key Idea
Digital Physics	Konrad Zuse (1969), Edward Fredkin (1978), Stephen Wolfram, J. Schmidhuber, etc.	The universe is ultimately a digital computation. Its evolution follows an underlying program or cellular automaton
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
.
It from Bit	John Archibald Wheeler (1989)	All physical reality (“its”) arises from binary choices/”bits” (yes/no information) – a participatory, informational cosmos.
Quantum Information	R. Landauer, W. Zurek, others	Quantum physics fundamentally deals with information; e.g., quantum states encode bits. (Links physics to information theory.)
Reddit and Online Discussions
Online forums reflect keen interest in nested-reality ideas. For example, users on r/SimulationTheory and r/HypotheticalPhysics frequently debate simulation and layered-universe models. On r/HypotheticalPhysics, a user proposed a “One-Bit-Pixel” model: a single-bit fundamental reality is rendered by the observer into the rich structure we perceive
reddit.com
. (This is akin to treating everything as information that gets “decoded” by consciousness.) Elsewhere, participants compare nested reality to Advaita Vedanta philosophy (one reality manifesting in many apparent forms). A Philosophy.SE thread also discussed whether infinite nested simulations are possible, with one answer insisting on a base reality
philosophy.stackexchange.com
. These discussions echo the above theories: forums often mention Bostrom’s simulation argument, Greene’s multiverse types, Smolin’s black-hole cosmos, and emerging consciousness models. Summaries from Reddit/StackExchange:
One-Bit-Pixel Hypothesis – On r/HypotheticalPhysics, user Icy-Investment4088 suggests reality is a single “bit” of information projected into our world
reddit.com
.
Nested Simulation Debates – On r/SimulationTheory and philosophy forums, users question if a simulation-of-a-simulation can continue indefinitely or requires an original real world
philosophy.stackexchange.com
.
Advaita Vedanta & Physics – On r/AdvaitaVedanta, comparisons are drawn between the Vedantic idea of appearance (Māyā) and “nested structures” in physics (including Nalamara’s ideas).
These community discussions highlight how Nested Reality-like concepts permeate science forums and philosophy threads, often spurring analogies to known theories.

Summary: Each of these works proposes multiple layers or levels underlying the world. Some (like Greene/Tegmark) do so via physics (extra dimensions, quantum branches); others (like Wheeler) do so via information. Nalamara’s Nested Reality fits into this broad milieu: it is one more attempt to explain how complex phenomena emerge from more basic layers. By categorizing these by theme (simulation, multiverse, consciousness, informational), we see common threads (hierarchy, emergence, recursion) and differences (digital vs. analog, spiritual vs. physical).
